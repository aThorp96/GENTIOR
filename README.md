Golang implementation of the GENTIOR TSP heuristic  developed ad Colorado State University with D. Fuquay and D. Whitley

The GENTIOR is described in Fuquay and Whitley's 1990 paper [Genetic Algorithm Solutions for the Traveling Salesman Problem](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99033&dl=ACM&coll=DL)

TODO:
- Add some biased parent selection methods to compare convergence
- Inspect for complexity issues
